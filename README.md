Q1:ComplexNumber
Write a class to represent a complex number of the form a + bi, where i is the imaginary square root of 1. The constructor should accept two doubles as arguments: the real part a and the imaginary part b. Use an assertion in the constructor to ensure that both of these numbers are positive. The methods you must provide are summarized in Figure 1-32. You may want to include others, such as a main() method for testing. One good test is to create the number 3 + 4i and print its magnitude:

ComplexNumber x = new ComplexNumber(3, 4);
System.out.println(x.getMagnitude());
This should print 5.0.

Q2:
Repeat Problem1, but with fields angle and magnitude instead of imaginary-Part and realPart. Your new class should behave exactly the same as the previous one.
